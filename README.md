# Image Classification examples using CNNs (PyTorch)

* cats_dogs: binary classification
    * data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog 
    * classify cats and dogs using two different networks:
	1. self implemented CNN
	2. Transfer Learning using the VGG16 model

* birds species: multiclass classification
   * data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species
   * classify 400 bird species with transfer learning using the VGG16 model

* crops: multiclass classification 
   * data: https://www.kaggle.com/aman2000jaiswal/agriculture-crop-images
   * The purpose of this exercise is to compare the workflow of Pytorch and Pytorch Lightning

* lego_figures: multiclass classification
   * data: https://www.kaggle.com/ihelon/lego-minifigures-classification
   * The purpose of this repository is to compare Tensorflow with PyTorch
